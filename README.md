## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- CSS logical functions
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learn how to create a sliding carousel from scratch and css animations. And to not skip defining properties for each element before coding in order to have a better work flow.

### Continued development

I'ld like to focus on creating a cleaner and maintainable code in JS. To read the brief and look on design throughly before jumping into code
